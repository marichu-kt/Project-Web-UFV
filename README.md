This project is based on HTML/CSS/JS code, designed for the work of the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject, 
it tries to ensure that users can easily follow each section and section in an efficient manner. It is also designed 
for onion routing search engines such as Tor Browser, which allows us to view this page on the Internet without having

## Known Issues

1. Error 404 - Not Found:

Currently, there is a problem when trying to search for a page that does not exist, since there is no 404 page that 
directs you to the previous one. This is one of the most well-known errors and occurs when the server cannot find the 
requested page. It is commonly associated with web pages not found. We are working to resolve this issue in the next version.

2. Error 403 - Forbidden

Currently we do not have a 403 error page developed that tells us that this is the cause of the failure, this error 
indicates that the server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it. The user may not have the appropriate 
permissions to access the page or resource. We are working to resolve this issue in the next version.

3. Error 500 - Internal Server Error

Currently we do not have a 500 error page developed that tells us that this is the cause of the failure, this is a generic 
message that indicates a problem on the server. It may be due to a bug in the application code, problems with server 
configuration, or even server overload. We are working to resolve this issue in the next version.


## Problems and Suggestions

If you find any problems or have suggestions to improve the page, please open an [issue](https://github.com/marichu-kt/project-html-website/issues).


## Conclusions and Next Steps

So far, the development of the system has progressed according to the initial plan. We have successfully implemented the basic functions requested for this project, we are open to receiving valuable feedback from users to improve. However, we recognize that there are still areas for improvement, especially in the errors that occur after searching for a non-existent page since the 404 error page is still in development and will appear in the next version.

## Next steps

1. **Release of Version 1.1:** We will address known issues and release a new version that improves the stability of the code in addition to suggestions from the community.

2. **Integration of New Features:** We are planning the integration of new features, such as the ability to add tags to tasks and message notification on the screen.
