                    <p class="knowledge__paragraph">A website is a set of web pages on the Internet. The reason why people create websites is diverse and covers a wide range of purposes. Some sites are designed to share information, whether educational, news, or descriptive. Others are business tools that allow companies to display and sell products or services online. Additionally, websites often serve as communication platforms, facilitating interaction between individuals, groups or companies. You can use WordPress to create it.</p>

                            of labels or tags that surround and describe the content of the page. These tags tell the 
                            web browser how to display and organize elements on the screen. HTML is used in web 
                            development and is the cornerstone for creating web pages.</p>
